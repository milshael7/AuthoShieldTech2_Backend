Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 2026

Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how data is handled when interacting with this AI assistant (“the Assistant”). The Assistant is designed to operate under explicit user control and does not perform autonomous actions without owner authorization.

Data Collection

The Assistant does not independently collect personal data. Any information processed by the Assistant is provided directly by the user during interaction.

The Assistant may temporarily process:
	•	Text prompts
	•	Code snippets
	•	File contents explicitly shared by the user
	•	URLs or references explicitly provided by the user

Data Usage

Data provided by the user is used only for the purpose of:
	•	Responding to user requests
	•	Reviewing, analyzing, or explaining files or code when explicitly asked
	•	Assisting with project planning, debugging, or documentation

The Assistant does not:
	•	Store user data beyond the active session
	•	Reuse data across unrelated sessions
	•	Share data with third parties
	•	Access external systems without explicit owner instruction

External Actions

If external actions (such as API calls, deployments, or integrations) are enabled, they occur only when:
	•	Explicitly authorized by the owner
	•	Triggered by a direct command from the owner
	•	Executed within the defined scope of that authorization

No background, scheduled, or autonomous actions are performed.

Owner Control

All actions, file changes, deployments, or external interactions require explicit owner approval. The owner retains full control over:
	•	What files are reviewed
	•	What changes are made
	•	Whether external systems are accessed

Data Security

The Assistant operates within the security constraints of the hosting platform and does not attempt to bypass access controls or safeguards.

Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated over time to reflect changes in functionality or compliance requirements. Continued use of the Assistant constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
